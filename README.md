# Deep Learning Journey with PyTorch

Welcome to my Deep Learning repository! This is a collection of code I've written while learning PyTorch and deep learning fundamentals.

## 📚 About This Repository

I created this repository to document my learning journey and to serve as a reference for myself and others who are beginning their deep learning adventure. The code here covers fundamental concepts and gradually builds up to more complex topics.

## 🎯 Purpose

- **Personal Reference**: A place where I can revisit concepts and implementations
- **Learning Resource**: Help others who are starting their deep learning journey
- **Community Learning**: Learn from feedback and improvements from the community

## 📂 Contents

- **Tensor Basics**: Creating, reshaping, and slicing tensors
- **Autograd**: Automatic differentiation in PyTorch
- **GPU Computing**: Moving tensors to CUDA for faster computation
- **Linear Regression**: 
  - Manual implementation (from scratch)
  - Using torch.nn module

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
python 3.x
pytorch
numpy
```

### Installation
```bash
pip install torch numpy
```

### Running the Code

Each script is self-contained and can be run independently:
```bash
python script_name.py
```

## 🤝 Contributing

I'm still learning, so if you find any mistakes, bugs, or areas for improvement in my code, please feel free to:

- Open an issue
- Submit a pull request
- Suggest better approaches

All contributions and feedback are greatly appreciated! Let's learn together.

## 📝 Note

This is a learning repository, so the code might not always follow production-level standards. The focus is on understanding concepts clearly rather than optimization.
